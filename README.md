# Ignou-Results-Scraper
Result Scraping Using Python

I created this script to scrape results from the university's website for my classsmates and myself.
Searching for our friends results one by one is a very cumbersome process so i created this script which:
  => Traverses through the website.
  => Takes screenshots of results.
  => Creates a pdf using these images.
  => Performs cleanup.

**THE SCRIPT IS DEPENDENT ON PYTHON SPLINTER, MAKE SURE YOU HAVE IT BEFORE RUNNING**
